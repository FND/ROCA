      <h1>ROCA: Resource-oriented Client Architecture</h1>
      <p><em>A collection of simple best practices for decent Web applications</em></p>

      <h2>Introduction</h2>

      <p>Web application architecture is heavily influenced by the
      design decisions, both implicit and explicit, that have been
      made by framework developers. Sometimes these decisions are
      consciously accepted as being in line with the intended overall
      system architecture. More often, though, they are accepted
      simply because developers assume they embody the state of the
      art of development practices. However, we find that very often
      frameworks are driven more by their authors&#8217; personal
      taste, the intent to create something new, a desire to hide the
      Web and turn it into something different, or any combination of
      these factors.</p>

      <p>ROCA is an attempt to define a set of recommendations -
      independent of any particular framework, programming language,
      or tooling - that embodies the principles of what we consider to
      be good web application architecture. Its purpose is to serve as
      a reference, one that can be implemented as is or be compared to
      other approaches to highlight diverging design decisions.</p>

      <div class='row-fluid'>
	<div class='span4'>
	  <h2>MUSTs</h2>
	  <p>A web application's architecture is compliant to the ROCA
	    style if it meets all of the following mandatory requirements:</p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>The server application adheres to REST principles,
              i.e. the server exposes a set of resources with their own URIs
	      that are meaningful to a user sitting in front of a browser, all
	      of the information necessary for handling a request is contained
	      in the request itself and the resource state maintained by the
	      server (stateless communication). The core application
              logic is contained on the server, and invoked by
              interacting with it through RESTful HTTP requests.
	    </li>
	    <li>The server returns structured HTML markup that is
	      independent of layout information; CSS is used for
	      formatting</li>
	    <li>In line with the principles
              of <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_enhancement'>progressive
              enhancement</a>, JavaScript is
              used <a href='http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unobtrusive_JavaScript'>unobtrusively</a>
              and the application is still usable (albeit with a
              decrease in usability and convenience) if JavaScript is
              disabled.</li>
	  </ol>
	</div>

	<div class='span4'>
	  <h2>SHOULDs</h2>
	  <p>The following concepts are encouraged, but not mandatory:</p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>Resources have additional representations in other formats, e.g.
	      JSON and/or XML</li>
	    <li>All authenticated communication relies on HTTP Basic
	      Authentication over SSL (or Client
	      Certificates). Alternatively, cookies can be used if
	      they include all of the state needed for the server to
	      process them</li>
	  </ol>
	</div>

	<div class='span4'>
	  <h2>MUST NOTs</h2>
	  <p>The following characteristics are clear indications that the ROCA style is violated:</p>
	  <ol>
	    <li>Cookies are used for purposes other than
	      authentication</li>
	    <li>There is session state beyond what&#8217;s needed for
	      simple algorithmic validation of authentication
	      information</li>
	    <li>Back button, bookmarking, linking to specific
	      information doesn&#8217;t work as expected by the
	      user</li>
	    <li>A browser refresh causes unexpected behavior (e.g. a
	      re-rendering of the login or home page)</li>
	    <li>The content sent to the client mainly consists of
	      JavaScript that retrieves the real content from the
	      server</li>
	  </ol>
	</div>
      </div>

      <a name='q-and-a'><h2>Q&amp;A</h2></a>

      <h3>Why ROCA?</h3>

      <p>In our work, we found that it&#8217;s far easier to get ideas
      across if they can be referred to by name, compared against
      other approaches, and thus be made tangible. ROCA is an attempt
      to provide a reference for exactly this purpose.</p>

      <h3>Why &#8220;ROCA&#8221;?</h3>

      <p>It was the most reasonable and easy-to-remember name we could
      come up with that also resolved to a meaningful acronym.</p>

      <h3>How can I install the framework?</h3>

      <p>You don&#8217;t &#8211; that&#8217;s the point. ROCA is
      intended to be framework-agnostic. You can pick any programming
      language, library, or framework, as long as you adhere to the
      aspects described above.</p>

      <p>If you really need a framework, we recommend you
      try <a href='http://www.dafk.net/what/'>here</a></p>.

      <h3>What are good frameworks that are a good choice for the ROCA style?</h3>

      <p>We plan to include a section on this, but would like to test
      the community&#8217;s reaction first.</p>

      <h3>But what about single-page apps? Aren't they the future?</h3>

      <p>We don't think so; in our view, single page apps repeat the
	mistakes of unnecessarily fat server-side Web frameworks on
	the client side. The fact that the Web relies on a series of
	resource representations that are linked to each other is not
	a bug, it's a feature.</p>
      
      <h3>Who&#8217;s behind ROCA?</h3>

      <p>The ROCA style itself is nothing new and can be seen in the
      wild in any number of Web applications. The name and this
      document have been created by Till Schulte-Coerne, Stefan
      Tilkov, Phillip Ghadir and Josh Graham.</p>
