JavaScript Widgets
------------------

This page lists suggestions for UI widgets which can be used unobtrusively.
[Suggestions](discussion.html) and
[contributions](https://github.com/innoq/ROCA) are welcome!

### Content Sections

jQuery UI's [tabs](http://jqueryui.com/tabs/) and
[accordion](http://jqueryui.com/accordion/) are excellent examples of powerful
interface components whose content remains accessible when JavaScript is
unavailable, thanks to a solid markup foundation.

[Accessible Tabs](https://github.com/ginader/Accessible-Tabs) is similar in
concept, but with special emphasis on accessibility.

### Date and Time Selection

Here too jQuery UI provides an exemplary implementation with its
[datepicker](http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/), a complex widget which is used to
populate a regular input field.

### Tabular Data

[List.js](http://listjs.com) extends lists and tables with search, filtering and
sorting functionality.

### Image Galleries

[Responsive Carousel](https://github.com/filamentgroup/responsive-carousel)
does a good job of providing a variety of enhanced presentations of a regular
list of images.
