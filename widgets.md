JavaScript Widgets
------------------

This page lists suggestions for UI widgets which can be used unobtrusively.
Further [suggestions](discussion.html) and
[contributions](https://github.com/innoq/ROCA) are welcome!

### Content Sections

jQuery UI's [tabs](http://jqueryui.com/tabs/) and
[accordion](http://jqueryui.com/accordion/) are excellent examples of powerful
interface components whose content remains accessible when JavaScript is
unavailable, thanks to a solid markup foundation.

[Accessible Tabs](https://github.com/ginader/Accessible-Tabs) is similar in
concept, but with special emphasis on accessibility.

### Input Suggestions

[Autocomplete](http://jqueryui.com/autocomplete/) is another from jQuery UI's
repertoire, populating a regular input field with arbitrary suggestions. Note,
however, that there is no standard convention for specifying the respective
source for suggestions, leaving it up to the user to ensure their solution is
ROCA compliant.

### Date and Time Selection

Again jQuery UI provides an exemplary implementation with its
[datepicker](http://jqueryui.com/datepicker/), a complex widget which is used to
populate a regular input field.

### Tabular Data

[List.js](http://listjs.com) extends lists and tables with search, filtering and
sorting functionality.

### Image Galleries

[Responsive Carousel](https://github.com/filamentgroup/responsive-carousel)
does a good job of providing a variety of enhanced presentations of a regular
list of images.
